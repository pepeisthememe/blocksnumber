valid block for nat pepes
is for the TAP doge community
You are free to mint these valid blocks, but there’s currently no way to know which ones are valid during mint. You’re not obligated to mint—it’s entirely at your own risk. We’re just artists, not developers. If you’d like to collaborate by creating a block validator for this collection, we’d greatly appreciate it. We’re working on the script to reveal your Pepe, so please be patient—it’s all for the community. We kindly ask the community for help to make NATpepes great. Share the word!
